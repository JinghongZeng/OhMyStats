# Introduction
This is a project in the course, STATS 765 Statistical Learning for Data Science. It is about sentiment analysis of English Wikipedia articles. I am new to text analysis and also `Spark NLP` & `Spark ML` which seem to be the top text analysis tools. My purpose is to learn `Spark` tools and how to apply them in sentiment analysis.

Different from quantitative data, text data can provide us with new and helpful aspects, such as attitude, sentiment and opinion. It is interesting to study the association between the sentiment and other variables. In this project, I studied the association between the sentiment and the article topic / popularity. `Spark` tools enabled me to use a variety of models including common ones, though it took some efforts to build explanatory models. 

Data, code in `Rmd` files and a report are uploaded. The data exploration process is excluded but should be necessary. Hoping to provide some introductory insight about sentiment analysis.
